heap sort
-Heap sort is a binary tree or 3 array tree...n-array tree
-when you want to construct heap tree you should atleast 
have alteat binary tree or strict or full binary tree
-heap 2 ty  pes:
	-->min
	-->max
max heap:-complete or almost complete binary tree where root 
	is max at everylevel

max-heapify(a,i)
{
	l=21;
	r-2i+1;
	IF(l<=a.heap-size &&a[l]>a[i])
	large = l
	else
	large = i
	if(r<=a.heap-size && a[r]>a[large]
	if(large not equals to i)
	exchange a[i] with a[large]
	max_heapify

	max_heap
//construct a heap 
1)find all the leaf index of which by defualt heap
2)find large index of non heap to 1
 
@psuedocode
build max heap(a)
{	
a.heap_size=a.length
for(i-[a.heap_size]/2to 1)//leap are bydefault heap
max_heapify(a,i)

//delete a max heap

error"heap is underfloe"
max = a[i]
a[i]=a.[a.heap-size]
a.heap_size=a.heap_size-1
max_heapify(a,i)
return max

@heap sort

for(i=a.lenght down to 2)
exchange a[i] with a[i]
